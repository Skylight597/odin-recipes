			<li>1 tbsp of Baking Powder</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp Salt</li>

			<li>1/2 C sugar</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp of Cinnamon</li>

			<li>1 Tbsp of Flour</li>

		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Begin by making the apple <strong>filling</strong></li>
			<li>Coat the apple pieces in the lemon juice and then the salt, sugar, and cinnamon</li>
			<li>Heat them in a saucepan over medium heat and bring the pieces to a simmer.  Continue to simmer until the apple pieces are soft and the sugar has carmelized.  The filling should be a thick, spoonable texture like apple pie filling.</li>
			<li>Once done, put the apple filling into a jar or other heat resistant container and allow to cool while you begin making <strong>the cake</strong>.</li>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Farenheit</li>
			<li>Sift the flour, your chosen spice, baking powder, nad salt together in a separate bowl and put it aside.</li>
			<li>Combine the softened butter and sugar together in a second bowl</li>
			<li>Add the eggs and stir until combined</li>
			<li>Add the yogurt, milk, and vanilla extract.  You can add additional milk if the batter is too thick (difficult to stir or doughy)</li>
			<li>Divide the batter in half.  Spread one half on the bottom of a greased backing pan</li>
			<li>On top of this batter layer, spread your cooled apple mixture</li>
			<li>Spread the second half of the batter on top</li>
			<li>Combine the <strong>topping</strong> ingredients in a bowl and mix until it appears homogenous in color.</li>
			<li>Sprinkle the topping on top of the cake, and then place in the oven</li>
			<li>Allow to bake for about 45 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean.</li>
			<li>Allow to cool for 20-30 minutes before serving.</li>
